To facilitate, you **explore** the diamond dataset in R and pay special attention to the cost of the diamond. Let's **explore** together.\n\n# Coding basics\n\n[Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html)\n\n-   When writing code, load all libraries first.\n\n-   \"\\##\" is used to write comments in R and should be used to justify next steps and anything unusual or unexpected steps\n\n-   Comments are really important and are notes to your future self to remind you about steps that you took and decisions that you made.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## loading library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n## First look at the dataset\nView(diamonds)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## What is in this dataset?\n?diamonds\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## What is the distribution of price?\nggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_dotplot(stackratio = 0.009, alpha = 0.05, stackdir = \"centerwhole\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n## What should the price of your diamonds be?\n\nBased upon the above plot, and since the diamonds are nice, they should all cost above $150,000, right?\n\n\n",
