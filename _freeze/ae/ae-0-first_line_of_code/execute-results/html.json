To facilitate, you **explore** the diamond dataset in R and pay special attention to the cost of the diamond. Let's **explore** together.\n\n# Coding basics\n\n[Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html)\n\n-   When writing code, load all libraries first.\n\n-   \"\\##\" is used to write comments in R and should be used to justify next steps and anything unusual or unexpected steps\n\n-   Comments are really important and are notes to your future self to remind you about steps that you took and decisions that you made.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## loading library\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data analysis and visualisation\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nThe `diamonds` dataset includes basic information about 53940 diamonds including price and other characteristics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## View the dataset in a separate tab\nView(diamonds)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe \\_\\_\\_ dataset has \\_\\_\\_ observations and \\_\\_\\_ variables.\n\nWhat are these variables and what do they mean?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## What are the variables in this dataset?\n## What are they counting?\n?diamonds\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. What do the \"4 c's\" of every diamond mean? What kind of variables are they? (hint: This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqB5Es1HXI4) may help)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## What is the distribution of price?\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price), binwidth = 1) \n```\n:::\n\n\n2. What does the binwidth in the geom_histogram() function do? (hint: draw multiple plots changing this value) What binwidth value is appropriate?\n\nThe distribution of diamond prices is right skewed (long right tail). There are no diamonds priced at about $1000. Let's explore this a little further...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiamonds %>% \n  filter(price > 750 & price < 1250) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\n3. What does the filter function do?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiamonds %>% \n  filter(price > 750 & price < 1250) %>% \n  mutate(price_hundred = price %/% 100) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\n4. What does this \"%/%\" operator do? (hint: run 10 %/% 3, 10 %/% 5, 7 %/% 3, 7 %/% 5 in the console and think carefully about /)\n\n5. What does the mutate function do? (hint: pay special attention to the dimensions of the data)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiamonds %>% \n  filter(price > 750 & price < 1250) %>% \n  mutate(price_hundred = price %/% 100) %>% \n  select(price, price_hundred) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\n6. What does the select function do? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiamonds %>% \n  filter(price > 750 & price < 1250) %>% \n  mutate(price_hundred = price %/% 100) %>% \n  select(price, price_hundred) %>% \n  count(price_hundred) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiamonds %>% \n  filter(price > 750 & price < 1250) %>% \n  mutate(price_hundred = price %/% 100) %>% \n  select(price, price_hundred) %>% \n  mutate(price_remainder = price %% 100) %>% \n  count(price_hundred, price_remainder) %>% \n  View\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis feature is probably better identified graphically.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n3. Based upon the above plot, how much should your charge for your diamonds? Why?\n\n",
