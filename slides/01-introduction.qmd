## Downloading software and creating a project

Prior to starting any statistics, software organization is crucial. Your high schools may have used google sheets or excel, but for our course we will be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Please see our [website](www.course-website.com/download_R) to download them, then download [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to get started.

Once this is completed, please open RStudio and do the following:

![Figure \@ref(fig:1) Start a new project in RStudio](~/images_intronew_project.png){fig-align="center" width="253"}

![Figure \@ref(fig:2) Select "New Directory"](~/images_intronew_directory.png){fig-align="center" width="230"}

![Figure \@ref(fig:3) Then select "New Project"](~/images_introdirectory_type.png){fig-align="center" width="277" height="61"}

Hit the "Browse" button, then the "New Folder" button and call this new folder "Stats1010." All work related to chapter 1 will be in this folder, and we will create a new project for each chapter and a new project for each homework.

then hit "Create project."

# Starting with packages

Quarto is a recently developed framework that interactively connects to multiple programming languages and allows for advanced statistical work to be linked to word processing with ease. It will be the basis for our course and for data analysis.

The R programming language was first released on 29 February 2000. Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman wanted a free, open-source language that their statistics students at the University of Auckland could use to fit statistical models. R is now an internationally recognized language used all over the world. It is possible to do a multitude of advanced computations in R but to keep R nimble, we don't download all of the things at once. Instead, coding is bundled together into something called "packages" that are stored on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Today we will explore the [here package](https://here.r-lib.org/). This package is used to organize files within R:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("here")
```

# Including your own data

To add data to your directory, first create a folder that

![Figure \@ref(fig:3) Adding a folder.](~/images_intronew_folder.png){fig-align="center" width="116"}

and name it "data". All data related to this chapter should be contained in this folder. In your file management system place your data in this folder. Then in the "Files" menu double-click on the dataset that you would like to import into R.

![Double click on the data you would like to install in the data folder in your project and select "Import Dataset."](~/images_introyour_own_data.png){fig-align="center" width="319"}

If this is the first time you are importing data, you may be prompted to download a package first. Follow the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to import the data. Check that the data is as you expect and update "Import Options" until it seems reasonable. Copy the coding from "Code Preview" and save put it in your document "so that when you restart R, you have coding that will import the data.

![When the data is imported, check the "Data Preview" to make sure it is what you expect. If not, change the "Import Options."](~/images_introimport_gui.png){fig-align="center" width="396"}

Notice that your environment tab will change and will show that you have data imported into R.

Congratulations! You have just imported your first dataset into R which is the first step in the data science workflow!
