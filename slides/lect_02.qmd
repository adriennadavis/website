## Why?

Today we will explore the [here package](https://here.r-lib.org/). This package is used to organize files within R:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("here")
```

## Including your own data

To add data to your directory, first create a folder that

![Figure \@ref(fig:3) Adding a folder.](images_intro/new_folder.png){fig-align="center" width="116"}

and name it "data". All data related to this chapter should be contained in this folder. In your file management system place your data in this folder. Then in the "Files" menu double-click on the dataset that you would like to import into R.

## Importing data

![Double click on the data you would like to install in the data folder in your project and select "Import Dataset."](images_intro/your_own_data.png){fig-align="center" width="319"}

If this is the first time you are importing data, you may be prompted to download a package first. Follow the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to import the data. Check that the data is as you expect and update "Import Options" until it seems reasonable. Copy the coding from "Code Preview" and save put it in your document "so that when you restart R, you have coding that will import the data.
