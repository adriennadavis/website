# Load packages, data

```{r load-packages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

## loading library
library(tidyverse) # for data analysis and visualisation
library(here) # to organize files
```

Let's look at the data [on the web](https://github.com/cosmoduende/r-marvel-vs-dc/blob/main/dataset_shdb/heroesInformation.csv) prior to importing it and also to ensure that we know what it should look like when it is imported into R.

Now press "raw"

![](ae-2_images/click_raw.png)

Then copy the url:

![](ae-2_images/copy_url.png)

Download the file by inserting the URL below:

```{r download-file, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

fs::dir_create(here("data")) # create a data folder 
download.file(
  url = URL_HERE, # url of file to download
  destfile = here("data/comics.csv") # directory/name_of_file
)
```

Then click on the data folder in the "Files" panel.

Double click on "comics.csv" and click on "Import Dataset..."

![](ae-2_images/import_dataset.png)

Check the data in the "Data Preview" pane and ensure that it looks as it should.

Next, click on the clipboard icon to copy the code from the "Code Preview" pane, then click "Import".

```{r import-data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#mPASTE THE CODE FROM "Code Preview" HERE
```

# Data

The `comics` dataset includes basic information scraped from the [superheroDb](https://www.superherodb.com/) for a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition.

```{r view-data, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

## View the dataset in a separate tab
glimpse(comics)
```

The first superhero is named "A-Bomb" he is male, with yellow eyes, human, with no hair. Marvel Comics created him and his skin color is not listed, but his height and weight are.

1.  Are there any differences between the data on the website above and the one in R? What are they? (Hint: which function can you use to see the whole dataset?)

2.  The \_\_\_ dataset has \_\_\_ observations and \_\_\_ variables.

3.  Classify all variables in the dataset as either: quantitative discrete, quantitative continuous, qualitative nominal, qualitative ordinal. Which of these variables is also categorical?

4.  How many publishers are there in this dataset?

    ```{r publisher_levels, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    ## What is the distribution of price?
    comics %>% 
      distinct(Publisher)
    ```

5.  How many levels of the variable Alignment are there in this dataset?

    ```{r alignment_levels, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    ## What is the distribution of price?
    comics %>% 
      INSERT_FUNCTION(INSERT_VARIABLE)
    ```
