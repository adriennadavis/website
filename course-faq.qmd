## How do I export my assignment PDF from RStudio to upload to Gradescope?

Go to your *Files* tab, check the box next to the file you want to download, then click on the blue gear icon on the Files tab to reveal the drop down menu, and select *Export*... If you have selected multiple files to export, RStudio will zip them up into a single zip file for you.
If you've selected just a single file, it will only download that.
The downloaded file will go to wherever files you download off the internet goes on your computer (usually your Downloads folder).
